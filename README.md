### 📌 Notable Projects
1. **[Go DynamoDB REST API](https://github.com/prashant231203/go-dynodb)**  
   - Built a scalable API with AWS DynamoDB integration, reducing latency by 30% through connection pooling.  
   - Implemented automated table migrations and containerized the service using Docker.  

2. **[RSS Aggregator (Go/PostgreSQL)](https://github.com/prashant231203/go-Aggregator-project)**  
   - Designed a concurrent feed processor handling 1k+ daily users using goroutines.  
   - Optimized PostgreSQL queries with indexing, cutting response times by 40%.  

3. **[gRPC Server](https://github.com/prashant231203/grpc)**  
   - Created a high-performance gRPC server with Protocol Buffers, achieving 2x faster response times vs REST.
